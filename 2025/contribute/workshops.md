## Overview
The ISMAR 2025 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the ISMAR conference. The workshops will be scheduled on October 8th (Wednesday) and October 12th (Sunday) and can be conducted in person, online, or in hybrid mode, in alignment with the ISMAR conference.

ISMAR workshops provide a platform for presenting novel work, work in progress, and position papers. The workshops bring together researchers, developers, technology providers, practitioners, and users for an in-depth and interactive discussion of important / emerging issues in augmented, mixed, and virtual reality through an informal yet thought-provoking exchange of ideas and information. We encourage workshops that go beyond the “mini-conferences” format of organization and promote interactive discussions among presenters and participants.

The workshops may target a specific application area, research area, or topic of general interest to the ISMAR community. The scope of the workshop should align with the main conference topics. For more details, please visit the conference website at [ISMAR 2025 website](https://www.ieeeismar.net/2025/)(https://www.ieeeismar.net/2025/).

We envision the workshops as launch pads to propel the ISMAR community forward in specific research directions, build a sub-community around shared research interests, and build bridges between ISMAR and other research communities.
Workshop proposals must be submitted before May 2nd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday). A committee will review the workshop proposals and notify the organizing team of acceptance by May 23th, 2025.

## Workshop Format

ISMAR workshops may be organized in different formats.  We encourage a format that involves interactions and discussions beyond a “mini-conference” format (i.e., a series of paper presentations followed by Q&A).  The workshop, for example, can be organized in a seminar style, where attendees are invited to participate in the discussion of the papers in the workshop actively.  Organizers may include, for example, break-out sessions, hands-on sessions, curated panels, or pro-contra discussions of reading lists. Workshops may also be organized as a combination of multiple formats. **The organizers should clearly explain the proposed format of their workshop in the proposal.**

## Publication Options

Workshop organizers can choose one of two options regarding publication: (1) The workshop’s papers will be published in ISMAR 2025 adjunct proceedings and IEEE Xplore (Accepted papers should be formatted using the [IEEE Computer Society VGTC format](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/) and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policy of ISMAR 2025), or (2) The workshop’s papers will not be published but will be distributed as supplemental material along with the ISMAR 2025 proceedings, as a part of the conference material.
