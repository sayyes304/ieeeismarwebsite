## Become a Student Volunteer (SV)

Whether your first or n-th attendance at a scientific gathering you will quickly come to realize that student volunteers are a critical component of their success! As such, ISMAR is calling for friendly and responsive volunteers to help us with the 2025 edition of this conference.
Volunteers help by being the friendly, helpful, and hard-working face of the event, taking on frontline tasks such as; managing the registration desk, helping set up demo sessions, providing on-site support to the organizing committee, assisting speakers during presentations, and more.


## Why You Should be a Student Volunteer

Don’t know how to start a conversation with that Professor you read every paper from? It’s easier when you have to register and welcome them to the conference!
Participating as a student volunteer gives you unique networking opportunities with our attendees, from young local and international researchers to world leaders in mixed and augmented reality. Volunteering for ISMAR 2025 is also an opportunity to gain academic service experience –an often-critical component of post graduate work–, and valuable hands-on experience for future scientific event organization.
Phrased differently, this is an opportunity to help shape the events of an international conference!
In addition to the experience, we recognize your time and effort contributions (see Expectations below) to delivering a smooth event by waiving your conference registration fee. Students also receive the same benefits as other conference attendees.

**Important note**: The registration fee waiver for student volunteers cannot be used to register a publication. If you are selected as a student volunteer, and your work has been accepted for presentation at ISMAR 2025, one of your co-authors must register for the conference and pay the author registration fee.

## Selection Guidelines and Eligibility

To join the ISMAR team as a volunteer, you must be enrolled as a PhD, Masters, or full-time undergraduate student at the time of the conference (October 8-12, 2025).

We encourage all students with a keen interest in cutting edge virtual, mixed and augmented reality research to apply. Further, submissions help us, the Committee, gain valuable feedback on our processes and the student experience that may inform future events. However, we acknowledge that Student Volunteer positions are often highly competitive as we receive many strong applications every year for the limited available positions so do not be disheartened if you are not selected. 

The following additional considerations will influence volunteer selection:

- **Selection for presentation at ISMAR 2025**.
- **Preference**: PhD students first, then masters, then undergraduate students.
- **Good communication skills in English**.
- **Previous experience in event organization** is desired but not required.
- The number of volunteers from each region, institution, and research group may be balanced to ensure broad participation.
- **Underrepresented groups** are especially encouraged to apply.
