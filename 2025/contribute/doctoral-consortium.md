## Overview
The Doctoral Consortium at ISMAR 2025 is a concentrated event where students present their research interests, plans, and results to a panel of researchers in related fields and receive specific and constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive valuable comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will create a poster to share their work with ISMAR ’25 Doctoral Consortium and general conference attendees. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the ISMAR 2025 online program. Abstracts may be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library.

## Eligibility and Topics

Ideal candidates will be in the early or mid-stage of their PhD and should have a solid idea of their research direction as well as dissertation topic, which may still have room for improvement. The consortium welcomes applicants from a broad range of disciplines including VR, AR, 3D user interfaces, human-computer interaction, wearable computing, social informatics, information technology, cognitive science, and related fields.
