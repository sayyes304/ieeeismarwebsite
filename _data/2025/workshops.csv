Available online,"XRMemory: 2nd International Workshop on Spatial Memory in XR
Defining and Capturing Memory for Interactive Playback in XR","This workshop focuses on the emerging challenge of recording and representing spatial experiences in a way that supports adaptive playback, particularly within XR environments. While photos and videos have long served as passive memory aids, the rise of AR/VR technologies and spatial computing enables the capture of experiences that are not only immersive but also interactive and reconfigurable—supporting interaction with recorded scenes, virtual avatars, AI agents, and other immersed and non-immersed humans.

This workshop aims to bring together experts across AI, XR, graphics, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs) to investigate the technological foundations for capturing, recreating, and sharing these dynamic spatial experiences. By fostering discussions on how these interdisciplinary technologies can enable richer, more vivid forms of memory retention and experience sharing, we hope to reshape the way we remember memories across the boundaries of time and space.

Available online,MIX: 1st International Workshop on Multisensory Interactions in Extended Reality,"The Multisensory Interactions in Extended Reality (MIX) workshop addresses the critical, yet underexplored, challenge of integrating visual, auditory, and haptic feedback into coherent and perceptually congruent Extended Reality (XR) experiences. While individual modalities like high-fidelity visuals and spatial audio continue to advance, a unified understanding of how to design for integrated multisensory perception is missing. A key theme will be the challenge of crossmodal congruence and integration, especially when dealing with asymmetric fidelity across senses. We will examine whether maximal realism is always the optimal goal, exploring if robust multisensory perception can potentially be achieved with lower-fidelity cues or sensory illusions. By bringing together researchers from cognitive psychology, computer science, HCI, and design, MIX aims to cultivate innovative approaches and theoretical insights needed to open new pathways for building XR systems that offer truly natural multisensory interactions.",https://mix-workshop.github.io/,"Laura Schütz, Sasan Matinfar, Yannick Weiss, Matthias Hoppe, Carlos García Fernández, Myung Jin Kim, Merle Fairhurst, Nassir Navab"

Available online,"TRUST-XR: The 1st International Workshop on Trustworthy, Secure, and Privacy-Aware artificial intelligence for Extended Reality Applications","The TRUST-XR 2025 workshop addresses the urgent need for trustworthy, secure, and privacy-aware artificial intelligence (AI) in extended reality (XR) applications. As XR technologies become increasingly integrated into domains such as education, healthcare, defense, workforce training, entertainment, and many more, the reliance on sensitive user data (e.g., eye-tracking, physiological signals, behavioral patterns) and complex AI models introduces critical risks related to privacy breaches, adversarial vulnerabilities, bias, lack of explainability, and user manipulation. Furthermore, recent trends of integrating generative AI (e.g., large language models (LLMs)) into XR applications for content generation and intelligent interaction further amplify these challenges. However, both conventional and generative AI models in XR systems function as black-box methods, offering little to no explainability and limiting user trust and system transparency. Integrating explainability with the AI models can significantly improve the model’s understanding and provide insight into why and how the AI model arrived at a specific decision. Meanwhile, XR systems rely on highly sensitive data, such as eye-tracking and physiological signals, which make them vulnerable to privacy breaches, identity inference, and behavioral manipulation. Moreover, these AI models used in XR applications are becoming more prone to attacks, where harmful inputs can cause wrong predictions or dangerous situations in immersive environments.

Available online,UNAI: 4th Workshop on Universal Augmented Interaction,"The era of generative content is upon the humankind. For the first time in the evolutionary history, our mind is pervasively experiencing multi-modal signals produced not by other living beings, but by mathematical models. We do not yet have an understanding of this phenomenon’s lasting effects on human cognition and behaviour. This especially concerns Virtual and Augmented Reality, which is known to “amplify” affections, particularly for inexperienced user groups. We believe that studying the new neural engagements’ potential benefits and threats is urgently called for.

This year UNAI’s motto is going to be “Accessible and Neurosecure Augmented Reality”. The UNAI workshop will bring in original research, review and position papers, as well as practical developments dedicated to various types of augmented interaction, including AI-enhanced interfaces and generated content, neural technologies, etc. The focus is on making today’s VR/AR safe and universally applicable, usable and accessible for all kinds of users, including non-technologically advanced ones, such as elder people, and in all contexts: at home and at work, in medicine/healthcare and in industry, as momentary entertainment and as everyday job. As with previous editions of our workshop, the scope involves human factors aspects and social implications, rather than technological nuances.

Available online,WoRXR: 5th Workshop on Replication in Extended Reality,"The ""replication crisis"" describes widespread failures to replicate empirical findings. Over 50% of previously reported results could only be replicated in a few cases. While originating in medicine and psychology, the replication crisis has also reached other empirical research areas, such as computer science. These issues have shaken the foundations of these fields: Can empirical results be believed? How can we support the reproducibility of increasingly complex interactive systems?

We invite researchers to conduct replication studies of their own (or others') previous experiments with a new set of participants. We anticipate that the current trend towards XR-based studies using, e.g., Quest or HoloLens, will make it easier to re-run existing experiments. Our workshop goal is to work towards a joint journal submission on lessons learned through replicated studies.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in replicating empirical research and algorithmic reproducibility of computing artifacts inside and outside the AR/VR/MR/XR community. Specifically, the workshop will introduce essential concepts and case studies, and then evolve into discussing position papers by participants.""

Available online,xrWORKS: 2nd International Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work ,"The 2nd International Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work (xrWORKS' 25) focuses on the emerging intersection between spatial computing and professional productivity. As XR technologies evolve from consumer-focused entertainment to tools for serious work, there is an urgent need to understand how immersive systems can meaningfully support knowledge workers across disciplines. Unlike traditional 2D desktop interfaces, XR workspaces offer expansive, adaptive environments that support multitasking, spatial reasoning, and embodied interaction, providing a new canvas for information-rich workflows.

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from XR, HCI, AI, cognitive science, ergonomics, and interaction design to examine how immersive systems can enhance focus, reduce cognitive load, and improve productivity in everyday knowledge work. We are particularly interested in systems that enable intelligent workspace reconfiguration, seamless multimodal interaction through gaze, gesture, and voice, and embodied AI agents that assist users through contextualized, adaptive support.

xrWORKS 2025 provides a platform to explore key challenges such as supporting multitasking across spatial displays, minimizing physical and cognitive fatigue, and ensuring user agency and privacy in immersive environments. In doing so, it aims to reshape how we conceive of work, attention, and collaboration in the age of spatial computing.

Available online,"IDEATExR: 5th Workshop on Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, Transparency and Ethics in XR","The potential benefits of XR should be for all, regardless of their cultural background, gender identity, race, neurodiversity, ethnicity, economic status, age, etc. However, our community is still facing challenges preventing equal involvement.

Most research within this space relies on the M-WEIRD user populations and is done by M-WEIRD researchers (Male, White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), effectively missing most of the world’s population [1], thus hindering the generalizability of findings and diversity of ideas. Approximately 95% of the global population is excluded from VR research [1] and only 15% of first-paper authors at IEEEVR are women [2]. Moreover, the ethics informing XR research have been identified as one of the grand challenges facing human-computer interaction research today, with the replication crisis featuring transparency as a critical step for remediation. More recently, global political forces have placed diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) research in the crosshairs, leading to reduced funding opportunities and a chilling effect in these research areas. It is more critical than ever for our research community to reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding research in these fields. Proactive support is essential not only to protect vulnerable lines of inquiry but also to ensure that evidence-based solutions continue to inform equitable research practice and applications in XR. These factors make formal discussions surrounding inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR not only timely but also necessary. And we want you to be part of this. It’s important to note that these concerns are also relevant to technical work not involving human participants as they also play a role in research teams, ideas, proposed solutions, conduct, etc.

Due to the important, evolving, and shifting nature of inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, trans- parency, and ethics in XR, this workshop has six main goals:

1. To provide a vehicle through which to understand better the pulse of the community surrounding issues of inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR,
2. To shine a spotlight on these issues for community members who perhaps haven’t seen or given them much consideration,
3. To celebrate those who are engaging in research either true to the spirit of inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR, or those engaging in research about these topics specifically,
4. To help researchers better understand how to ensure their works are more inclusive, diverse, equitable, accessible, transparent, and ethical, particularly in their software and study design,
5. To spotlight how people are represented in XR technologies (or not) as researchers, designers, partici- pants, and users, and
6. To bring together disparate perspectives and research foci under a shared goal to be inclusive, diverse, equitable, accessible, transparent, and ethical in XR. This goal can be shared by software, hardware, and human-focused researchers. 

Workshop participants will have the opportunity to provide their insights on what is—and what isn’t— working for our community, thereby helping to shape the future of XR research.",https://ideatexr.carrd.co/,"Lee Lisle, Cassidy Nelson, Matt Gottsacker, G. Nikki Ramirez, Zubin Datta Choudhary"
Available online,MARMH: Mixed/Augmented Reality for Mental Health,"Mental health conditions pose a major challenge to healthcare providers and society at large. The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading disease burden globally. Mental health services are struggling to meet the needs of users and arguably fail to reach large proportions of those in need. Early intervention, support and education can have significant positive impact on a person's prognosis. 

Augmented, Virtual and/or Mixed Reality environments can create new effective models in the wider context of prevention and support for individuals affected by mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, addictive behaviours and substance abuse disorders. 

Following our successful ISMAR 2019 (China), ISMAR 2021 (Italy), ISMAR 2022 (Singapore), ISMAR 2023 (Australia) and ISMAR 2024 (USA) workshops on the same topic as well as a special issues we recently organised at Virtual Reality journal, the goal of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for Extended Reality researchers and Health researchers and practitioners to submit their original ideas, work-in-progress contribution, and position papers on the design and/or evaluation of new mental health technologies. We are interested in theoretically, empirically, and/or methodologically oriented contributions focused on supporting mental health delivered through novel designs and evaluations of on AR/VR/MR systems. In addition to potential benefits, we would also like to receive contributions on potential dangers of using such technologies for addressing mental health issues.",/2025/contribute/workshop-papers/mental-health,"Nilufar (Nell) Baghaei, Hai-Ning Liang, Stephen Viller, Richard Porter, Mark Billinghurst"
